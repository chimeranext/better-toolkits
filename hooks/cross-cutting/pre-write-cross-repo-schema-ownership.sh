# Cure 4b cross-cutting hook (legacy-ticket #2): block creation of SQL
# migrations for tables this repo does not own.
#
# Generalized from
# chimera-agent-openclaw-plugin/.claude/hooks/pre-write-plugin-side-migration.sh
# (legacy-ticket). The 4a hook hard-blocks ANY supabase/migrations/*.sql write
# because the gateway repo has no migration pipeline; the 4b
# generalization supports two modes via per-repo config:
#
#   owned_tables: []        → block every write in the configured
#                             migration_paths (gateway pattern: no migrations
#                             at all belong in this repo)
#   owned_tables: [...]     → block only writes that touch a CREATE/ALTER/
#                             DROP for a table not in the allowlist
#                             (chimera-os pattern: this repo owns chat_sessions,
#                             chat_messages, ...; reject migrations for tables
#                             owned by other repos)
#
# Surface: `schema_ownership`
# Bypass:  `# hook-bypass: cross-cutting-schema-ownership` or `// ...`
#
# Tool match: Write only. Edit/MultiEdit on existing migrations is
# expected (e.g. cleanup "moved to other repo" comments).
#
# Fail-open on missing jq, malformed input, missing/disabled config,
# `defer_to_local_hook: true`, or `CLAUDE_DISABLE_PLUGIN_HOOKS=1`.

BLOCKED [${HOOK_NAME}]: this repo's cross-cutting-hooks.json declares
owned_tables=[] for the migration_paths under discipline, meaning this
repo has no migration pipeline and should not host SQL migrations.

Attempted file: ${FILE_PATH}

Why this hook exists (legacy-ticket / legacy-ticket / legacy-ticket):
  The gateway repo's PR #235 introduced a chat_sessions migration that
  was silently dropped (no workflow applies migrations in that repo).
  Result: 15 days of silent persistence freeze. This guard prevents the
  same failure mode in any repo that opts in.

How to fix:
  - Move the migration to the repo that owns the schema (e.g. chimera-os
    for chat_* tables: supabase/migrations/ + deploy-migrations.yml).
  - If this repo SHOULD own some tables, add them to
    .claude/config/cross-cutting-hooks.json → schema_ownership →
    owned_tables and the hook will allow migrations touching those.

Bypass (intentional historical artifact only):
  Add "# hook-bypass: ${BYPASS_MARKER}" inside the migration file.

Defer to local 4a hook:
  Set schema_ownership.defer_to_local_hook = true in
  .claude/config/cross-cutting-hooks.json.

Owned tables:   $(printf '%s' "$OWNED_LIST" | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')

Why this hook exists (legacy-ticket / legacy-ticket / legacy-ticket):
  Schemas live in one repo per table family. Writing a migration for a
  table owned by another repo means the migration ships from the wrong
  pipeline (may be silently dropped, may double-apply, may race the
  canonical owner's migration). legacy-ticket was 15 days of silent
  persistence freeze caused by exactly this failure.

How to fix:
  - Confirm which repo owns each listed table (check the canonical
    repo's supabase/migrations/ history).
  - Move this migration to the owning repo.
  - If this repo should own a listed table, add it to
    .claude/config/cross-cutting-hooks.json → schema_ownership →
    owned_tables.

Bypass (single-migration override only):
  Add "# hook-bypass: ${BYPASS_MARKER}" inside the migration file.

Defer to local 4a hook:
  Set schema_ownership.defer_to_local_hook = true in
  .claude/config/cross-cutting-hooks.json.
