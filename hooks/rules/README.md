# Rules manifest — contributor guide

This directory holds the **single source of truth** for every rule the
make-no-mistakes hooks enforce.

- `rules.yaml` — humans edit this. One row per rule, atomic fields.
- `rules.json` — generated build artifact. Runtime (`hooks/lib/eval-rule.sh`)
  reads this; never edit by hand.
- `scripts/build-rules.mjs` — `npm run build-rules` regenerates `rules.json`
  and validates schema. CI fails if `rules.json` is stale.

## Schema

Every rule is one YAML row with these fields:

```yaml
- id: <kebab-case-unique>           # required, used to cite the rule
  description: <one-line>           # required, shown in stderr on match
  applies_to: [Bash | Edit | Write | MultiEdit | Slack]   # required, non-empty
  match:                            # required, non-empty array (AND-chain)
    - field: command | file_path | content | text
      pattern: '<ERE regex>'        # optional; if present, field MUST match
      not_pattern: '<ERE regex>'    # optional; if present, field must NOT match
      flags: i                      # optional; only "i" (case-insensitive) supported
  action: block | warn              # required
  bypass_marker: <kebab-case> | null  # optional acknowledgement token
  memory_ref: <filename>            # optional metadata only — NOT printed at runtime
  message: |                        # required, multi-line stderr output
    Block / warning text shown when this rule fires.
  tests:                            # required, non-empty array
    - name: <kebab-case>
      input:
        tool_input:
          command: '...'           # OR file_path / content / text
      expected_exit: 0 | 2          # 0 = allow / warn; 2 = block
      expected_stderr_contains: '<substring>'  # optional
```

### Match semantics

Conditions in `match` form an **AND-chain**: the rule fires only when ALL
conditions hold. Within a single condition:

- `pattern` and `not_pattern` operate on the same field.
- If both are present, `pattern` must match AND `not_pattern` must NOT match.
- If only `not_pattern` is present, the condition is "this field must NOT
  match this pattern" (no positive requirement).

To express OR across conditions, write multiple rules with the same effect
(e.g., one rule per `applies_to` tool). To express OR within a single
condition, use ERE alternation in `pattern` (e.g., `(php -r|set_config)`).

### Bypass markers

If `bypass_marker: foo-rule`, the rule is skipped when the literal substring
`// hook-bypass: foo-rule` or `# hook-bypass: foo-rule` appears anywhere in
the raw tool_input JSON. Bypasses are explicit acknowledgements — they sit
inside the command/content itself, not as silent flags.

`bypass_marker: null` (or omitted) means the rule cannot be bypassed.

## Adding a rule

1. Edit `rules.yaml` — append a new row following the schema.
2. Run `npm run build-rules` to regenerate `rules.json`. Schema errors
   surface at this step (missing fields, invalid action, etc.).
3. Run `npm run test-hooks` to verify your `tests` array passes.
4. Commit both `rules.yaml` AND `rules.json` (CI verifies they're in sync).

## IP-leak guard (opt-in, gitignored)

If the build output says `IP-leak guard active`, you have a local
`.private/forbidden-names.txt` (one regex per line) that the build script
checks against the serialized rules. Use this to prevent committing client
or org names in test fixtures, references, or messages. The list lives
gitignored so the toolkit itself never publishes the names.

Example `.private/forbidden-names.txt`:

```
# One regex per line, # for comments
mycompany
client-acme
client-beta
```

## Tier 2 — decomposing non-deterministic memories

Many narrative-style guidelines can be converted to deterministic rules
using these techniques:

- **T1 Narrative → structural assertion.** "Slack alerts group by project →
  milestone → assignee" becomes a rule that parses the message and asserts
  the labels appear in that order.
- **T2 Scope boundary → path-based block.** "Don't edit X owner's domain"
  becomes a rule with `field: file_path` matching the owner's path glob.
- **T3 Behavioral mandate → Stop-event reminder.** "Never ask 'should I
  continue?'" becomes a Stop hook that scans the recent assistant message
  for stop-asking patterns and surfaces a reminder for the next turn.
- **T4 Preference → linter on alternative.** "Don't use 'refactor' in PR
  titles" becomes a PreToolUse rule on the gh/Linear API that warns when
  the title contains the discouraged word.
- **T5 Fall-through judgment → explicit gate.** "Don't mark complementary
  issues as blocking" becomes a PreToolUse rule on save_issue that, when
  `blockedBy` is set, requires a `blocking_reason:` key in the description.
- **T6 Context-sensitive → structural proxy.** "Filter PostHog from alerts"
  becomes a PostToolUse rule that detects alert-shaped messages (3+ issue
  refs in same body) and warns when posthog/dashboard/instrumentation
  keywords appear.
- **T7 Multi-part → AND-chain of detectors.** Combine path + content +
  exception detectors in `match` to express compound rules.

Use these patterns when proposing new rules — most "soft" guidelines can be
converted to deterministic checks with a structural proxy.
