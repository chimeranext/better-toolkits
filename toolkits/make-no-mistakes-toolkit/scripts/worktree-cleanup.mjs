 *
 * ## Why this is a program and not a prose checklist
 *
 * This tool DELETES. The value is entirely in what it refuses, and a refusal
 * written as a bullet point in a skill is a refusal that runs only when the
 * reader remembers it. Every refusal below is a predicate with a name, an
 * evidence string, and a test.
 *
 * The cost asymmetry is the whole design. Twenty gigabytes of stale worktrees
 * costs nothing but disk. One removed worktree holding the only copy of
 * someone's commits costs the work itself, and no later command recovers it.
 * So the classifier is biased all the way to the safe side: anything it cannot
 * MEASURE as safe comes back `unverifiable`, and `unverifiable` never collapses
 * into `remove`.
 *
 * ## The refusals, and what each one is protecting
 *
 *   main-checkout        `git worktree list` puts the repository itself first.
 *                        It is never a candidate, for either action.
 *   locked               `git worktree list --porcelain` reported `locked`.
 *                        A lock means someone or something claimed it.
 *   uncommitted          `git status --porcelain` is non-empty. Untracked files
 *                        count: they are work with no other copy either.
 *   mid-operation        A merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert or bisect is
 *                        STOPPED here. This state lives in the worktree's git
 *                        dir, NOT in the file list, so it is invisible to every
 *                        other check — and it does not resolve itself.
 *   unpushed             The branch is AHEAD of its upstream. This is the
 *                        single most likely way to destroy work, because a
 *                        branch that is ahead is not stale — it is unfinished.
 *   not-merged           No merge evidence from any of the three tests below.
 *
 * ## Why `mid-operation` is its own check and not a corollary of `uncommitted`
 *
 * The intuition is that a stopped merge always leaves conflict markers, so the
 * dirty check covers it. Measured, on a repository built for the question:
 *
 *   two branches add the SAME file with the SAME content. `git merge --no-commit`
 *   auto-merges cleanly, the resulting tree is byte-identical to HEAD's, and
 *   `git status --porcelain` returns ZERO lines while `MERGE_HEAD` exists.
 *
 * Against that worktree the classifier returned `remove` with an empty findings
 * list, and `git worktree remove` then took it — exit 0, no output, no refusal
 * of its own. Git offers no protection here; this check is the protection.
 *
 * ## "Merged" is measured three ways, and the third is the common one
 *
 *   ancestor   `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/<base>` — a true merge
 *              commit or a fast-forward. Cheap, local, and WRONG for most of
 *              this repo's history.
 *   cherry     `git cherry origin/<base> <branch>` with every line `-` — the
 *              commits are patch-equivalent upstream. Catches rebase-merges.
 *   pr         A GitHub PR whose `state == MERGED` has this branch as its head.
 *
 * A SQUASH merge collapses N commits into one new commit with a new patch id,
 * so the branch is neither an ancestor of the base nor patch-equivalent to it.
 * Ancestry alone therefore reports "not merged" for work that certainly landed,
 * and in a squash-merge repo that is the MAJORITY case — which is why the `pr`
 * test exists and why losing `gh` downgrades a verdict to `unverifiable`
 * instead of to `not-merged`.
 *
 * ## Two ambiguities that are reported rather than resolved
 *
 *   branch-changed-under-us   The branch `git worktree list` recorded and the
 *                             branch the worktree reports RIGHT NOW disagree.
 *                             A sibling process re-checked it out mid-run; the
 *                             measurements above describe a state that is gone.
 *   commits-after-merge       The PR merged, and the branch tip is NEWER than
 *                             `mergedAt`. Something was added after the merge,
 *                             and that something is not covered by the PR.
 *
 * ## No stream is ever discarded
 *
 * Every subprocess runs through `run()` with `stdio: 'pipe'` and no shell, so
 * stderr is captured and surfaced rather than dropped. An empty result from a
 * command that ERRORED must never read as "found nothing" — in this tool that
 * misreading is the difference between "no unpushed commits" and "the check
 * did not run".

worktree-cleanup — reclaim disk from git worktrees, refusing the ones that hold work

  node scripts/worktree-cleanup.mjs [repo] [options]

  (default)            DRY RUN. Reports the node_modules it would reclaim.
  --worktrees          Also classify worktrees for removal (merged + clean + pushed).
  --no-node-modules    Skip the node_modules pass.
  --apply              Actually delete. Without it nothing is removed.
  --force              Pass --force to \`git worktree remove\`. Only when you asked for it.
  --base <branch>      Measure "merged" against exactly this branch. Default: the SET
                       {origin/HEAD, develop, main, master, trunk} that actually exists.
  --no-fetch           Skip \`git fetch\` (measurements then run against stale refs).
  --no-gh              Skip the PR check. Squash-merged branches become unverifiable.
  --json               Machine-readable output.
