# Skill `merge-advisor` — protocol SSOT

---

# Merge Advisor

A pile of PRs is open against one base. Each was measured green **against a base
that no longer exists by the time its turn comes**. This skill computes the
order that keeps them green, then **always** offers to execute that order under
HITL. There is no `--execute` flag — the approval question *is* the product.

## The question nobody else answers

Three skills look at PRs and only one of them answers ordering:

| skill | question | unit |
|-------|----------|------|
| `review-open-prs` | which PRs need attention? | one PR at a time |
| `sync-advisor` | this checkout drifted, what do I run? | one branch vs its base |
| **`merge-advisor`** | **in what ORDER, so each is still valid at its turn?** | **the SET** |

The distinction is not bookkeeping. **"Mergeable" is not a property of a PR. It
is a property of the pair (PR, base-it-will-land-on).** A per-PR report reads
every row against *today's* base, and the moment the first merge lands, every
other row is describing a base that is gone. Ten green PRs is not ten merges.

## HITL doctrine (mandatory — not opt-in)

Repo-wide parent: [`docs/hitl.md`](../../../../docs/hitl.md). This section is the
`/merge-advisor` application of that doctrine.

Two halves, in this order. Neither is optional.

### Half A — measure (autonomous)

The seven predicates run without asking. One mutation is allowed without HITL:
`git fetch origin --quiet` (remote-tracking refs only). Without it every
measurement is against a stale base.

Print the full plan (tiers, full PR URLs, not-in-order, capacity). The plan
alone is not the end of the skill.

### Half B — execute under HITL (always)

Immediately after the plan, the orchestrator **must** ask for an explicit OK.
Do not end with “run these `gh pr merge` yourself.” Do not invent `--execute`.

**Harness surface (same doctrine as `/implement`):**

| Harness | How to ask |
|---------|------------|
| Claude Code | `AskUserQuestion` |
| Cursor | equivalent in the main conversation: numbered options + wait for an explicit reply (never treat silence as yes) |
| Background sub-agent | do **not** ask; emit `pause` JSON with `gate: "merge-advisor-queue"` and halt — orchestrator asks and relays |

Minimum question after the plan:

> **Execute this merge plan?**
>
> 1. **Yes — tier by tier** (recommended): merge the next tier, re-measure, ask again.
> 2. **Yes — one PR** (name which from Tier 1).
> 3. **Plan only** — do not merge this session.
> 4. **Stop** — do not merge.

For choices 1–2, **another hard STOP before each `gh pr merge`**: PR URL, merge
method, freshly read `mergeable` / checks. After each successful merge: re-run
`force_mergeable` on the remainder, re-derive tiers if the shape changed, ask
HITL again. A plan printed once and followed for an hour is a plan whose later
tiers measured the wrong base.

**Never offer a bypass as an option.** `--admin`, `--force`, merging past a red
or unanswered check, disabling a required check to unblock a queue — none of
these is a row in a menu. If the ordering is blocked, the block is the finding.

Regeneration commands and any `git rebase` / `git push --force-with-lease`
needed to unblock a PR also require HITL.

## Step 0 — Resolve the base and the PR set

`$BASE` is a **bare branch name** (`develop`, never `origin/develop`). Every
command below interpolates `origin/$BASE`, so a value carrying the remote becomes
`origin/origin/develop`, which is not a ref.

```bash
# 1. a base the user named explicitly — take it
# 2. the repo's PR default
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
# 3. otherwise probe, in order
for b in develop main master trunk; do
  git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$b" && { echo "$b"; break; }
done
```

Normalise unconditionally, then fetch:

```bash
BASE=${BASE#refs/remotes/}; BASE=${BASE#origin/}
git fetch origin --quiet
```

Enumerate the set, and **fetch every PR head as a local ref** — the measurements
below need the actual commits, not just their SHAs:

```bash
gh pr list --base "$BASE" --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,headRefName,headRefOid,isDraft,mergeable,author,url

# Materialize the heads. Without this, merge-tree has nothing to read.
gh pr list --base "$BASE" --state open --json number --jq '.[].number' \
  | while read -r n; do git fetch origin "pull/$n/head:pr-$n" --quiet --force; done
```

Record `### ref: origin/$BASE @ <sha>` above every measurement that follows.
An order computed against an unnamed base is an opinion.

## Step 1 — The seven predicates

Run all of them. Predicates 4 and 5 are the two that no per-PR view can produce.

| # | Predicate | Answers |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Eligibility | Which PRs are candidates at all? |
| 2 | Check freshness | Is that green mark about the CURRENT base? |
| 3 | Conflicts with base NOW | Which need work before anything else happens |
| 4 | **Pairwise file collision** | **Which PRs touch the same files** |
| 5 | **Latent conflicts** | **Which pairs conflict with EACH OTHER, not with base** |
| 6 | Base-anchored artifacts | What every other PR must regenerate after a merge |
| 7 | Queue capacity | How many can be in flight without starving CI |

### 1. Eligibility — and you must FORCE the mergeable calculation

GitHub computes mergeability **lazily**, and the shape of that laziness is worse
than "it might be stale". Measured against a live repo with 8 open PRs on
2026-08-02:

```bash
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls?state=open&per_page=8" \
  --jq '.[] | {n: .number, mergeable, state: .mergeable_state}'
#  {"mergeable":null,"n":4309,"state":null}
#  {"mergeable":null,"n":4308,"state":null}      ... all 8 null
```

```bash
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/4309" --jq '{mergeable, mergeable_state}'
#  {"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable"}
```

**The list endpoint never populates these fields.** Not "not yet" — never. They
exist only in the individual-PR representation, and the two calls above were
made seconds apart, so 4309's value was already computed when the list returned
`null` for it. Anything built from `gh pr list` reads `null` on every row, and a
consumer that treats `null` as a value gets eight PRs that look identical.

This matters more here than in a status report. `review-open-prs` reading a
stale field produces one wrong row; **merge-advisor reading it produces a wrong
ORDER**, and the order is the whole output.

So force it, per PR, and poll rather than guessing at a sleep:

```bash
force_mergeable() {                       # $1 = PR number
  local n="$1" try=0 delay=2 out
  while [ "$try" -lt 5 ]; do
    # The individual endpoint is what STARTS the background job. Reading it is
    # the trigger, so the first call is expected to come back uncomputed.
    out=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$n" \
            --jq '{mergeable, mergeable_state}' 2>>"$MNM_LOG")
    case "$out" in
      *'"mergeable":null'*|'') ;;         # still computing, or the call failed
      *) printf '%s\n' "$out"; return 0 ;;
    esac
    sleep "$delay"; delay=$(( delay * 2 )); try=$(( try + 1 ))
  done
  printf '{"mergeable":"unverifiable","after":%d}\n' "$try"; return 2
}
```

Three properties of that loop, each load-bearing:

- **Backoff, not a fixed `sleep 5`.** The job takes as long as the diff is
  large, so a constant wait is either wasted time on small PRs or a premature
  give-up on big ones — and big PRs are exactly the ones this skill orders first.
- **stderr goes to a log, never to `/dev/null`.** A failing `gh` call and a PR
  that is genuinely still computing both return empty, and discarding stderr
  makes them the same event. `$MNM_LOG` is `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/merge-advisor.log`.
- **Exhausting the retries returns `unverifiable`, not a guess.** Not `"clean"`,
  not `"calculating"` — a fourth adjective is how three states become two again.

Then read the rest, which are cheap and not lazily computed:

```bash
gh pr view "$N" --json isDraft,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup
```

**`mergeable: true` is not `CLEAN`.** In the same measurement, 4 of 8 PRs read
`mergeable_state: "unstable"` — the branch applies, and its checks are failing
or pending. `unstable` is a merge that *works* and *should not happen yet*. Use
`mergeable` for the ordering constraint and `mergeable_state` for eligibility;
collapsing them produces an order that is technically applicable and wrong.

A draft is not a candidate. Say so as a row rather than dropping it silently:
a PR missing from the plan reads as "already handled".

### 1b. Re-force it between tiers — the value expires on every merge

This is the part a per-PR tool never needs and this one cannot skip.

`mergeable` is computed **against the base as it stands**. The instant Tier 1
lands, every value measured for Tier 2 describes a base that no longer exists —
which is the premise of this whole skill, applied to its own inputs. GitHub does
not proactively recompute; it invalidates and waits to be asked again.

So `force_mergeable` runs again for every remaining PR **after each tier**, and
a plan printed once and followed for an hour is a plan whose later tiers were
computed against the wrong base. If the recomputation changes the shape, the
remaining tiers are re-derived rather than executed as printed.

### 2. Check freshness — the green mark's expiry date

```bash
# What base SHA was the rollup computed against?
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/$(gh pr view "$N" --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)/check-runs" \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | {name, conclusion, started_at}'

# How far has the base moved since this PR last saw it?
git rev-list --count "pr-$N..origin/$BASE"
```

`gh pr checks` has no `--json`; use the check-runs API.

A green check computed 84 commits ago tested a tree that no longer resembles the
merge result. **This is not a reason to distrust the PR** — it is the reason
ordering exists. Record the distance; it feeds the fragility ranking in Step 2.

### 3. Conflicts with the base as it stands

If the repo already has a program that answers this, **run it** rather than
re-deriving it — a second implementation of a measurement drifts exactly like a
second implementation of code. Look for one before reaching for `merge-tree`:

```bash
ls scripts/ | grep -iE 'mergeab|conflict'
```

Otherwise, and note the redirect order — `2>&1 >/dev/null` keeps stderr, which
`>/dev/null 2>&1` throws away along with the ability to tell "no conflicts" from
"the command failed":

```bash
git merge-tree --write-tree "origin/$BASE" "pr-$N" 2>&1 >/dev/null; echo "exit=$?"
# exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = conflicts, anything else = the command itself failed
```

Treat a non-0/1 exit as **unverifiable**, never as clean.

### 4. Pairwise file collision — the matrix

```bash
# The files each PR touches, against the merge base rather than the branch tip
git diff --name-only "$(git merge-base "origin/$BASE" "pr-$N")...pr-$N"
```

Then intersect every pair. Two PRs sharing zero files are order-independent and
can be batched together; two sharing a file are a sequencing decision even when
neither currently conflicts, because a clean textual merge of two edits to the
same file is exactly how a semantic conflict ships green.

Report the intersection **by filename**, not as a count. "PR #A and PR #B
overlap on 3 files" is unactionable; naming `lefthook.yml` tells the reader
which of the two is the cheap rebase.

### 5. Latent conflicts — the ones that do not exist yet

The dangerous conflict is not the one blocking a PR today. It is the one that
appears **only after an earlier PR lands**, in a PR that is green right now.

```bash
# Simulate: does B still apply once A has landed?
git merge-tree --write-tree "pr-$A" "pr-$B" 2>&1 >/dev/null; echo "exit=$?"
```

Run this for every pair that Step 4 flagged as overlapping. A pair that is clean
against base and dirty against each other is a **hard ordering constraint**, and
it is invisible to `gh pr list`, to any per-PR status report, and to the PR
author.

If the exit code is neither 0 nor 1, report `unverifiable` and name the pair.
Do not fill the cell by inference.

### 6. Base-anchored artifacts — generalised

Some checked-in files are **derived from the base** and carry the base SHA they
were derived from. When the base moves — and especially when a **squash merge**
rewrites it — that anchor points at a commit that no longer exists, and the
artifact breaks on **every open PR at once**. One merge, N failures, none of them
caused by the PR they appear on.

This skill does not hardcode any project's artifact. **Discover them:**

```bash
# Files carrying a base SHA, a "baseline", or a generated-from marker
git grep -lE '(baseSha|sourceSha|baselineSha|generatedFrom|"base":\s*"[0-9a-f]{7,40}")' \
  "origin/$BASE" -- . | head -20

# Common shapes, by convention rather than by name
git ls-tree -r --name-only "origin/$BASE" \
  | grep -iE '(baseline|snapshot|\.lock$|lockb?$|generated|__snapshots__)'
```

For each candidate, ask the two questions that decide whether it constrains the
order:

1. **Is it touched by more than one open PR?** If one, it is that PR's problem.
2. **Is it regenerated from the base rather than authored?** A lockfile and a
   typecheck baseline both are; a hand-written config is not.

Both yes means a **regeneration checkpoint** goes into the sequence: a point at
which every remaining PR re-derives the artifact before its checks are trusted.
Print the regeneration command the repo already provides — find it, do not
invent it:

```bash
grep -nE '"(baseline|typecheck|gen:|generate)' package.json
```

If no regeneration command exists, say so: the artifact is anchored with no way
to re-anchor it, and **that is a defect to file, not a step to improvise.**

### 7. Queue capacity

Measure it. A recommendation to "merge three at a time" with no measurement
behind it is a guess wearing a number.

```bash
# In-flight and queued runs right now
gh run list --limit 40 --json status,name,createdAt \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.status == "in_progress" or .status == "queued")] | length'

# Runners and their state (self-hosted fleets)
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners" --jq '.runners[] | {name, status, busy}'
# org-level fleets live at: gh api "orgs/{org}/actions/runners"
```

Each merge into the base triggers the base's own workflows **plus** a re-run on
every remaining open PR that auto-syncs. On a FIFO fleet with no priority lane,
merging four at once can queue deeper than the fleet drains, and the last PR's
checks then report against a base two merges further along than the one they
started on.

Batch size is `min(idle runners, count of collision-free PRs in the current
tier)`. State both inputs.

## Step 2 — Order the set

Apply in this order. Earlier rules are hard constraints; the last is the
tie-breaker.

1. **Latent-conflict edges (predicate 5) are directed and non-negotiable.** If B
   fails to apply over A, then A precedes B, and B carries a rebase note. If the
   pair conflicts in both directions, they are not orderable — the two authors
   reconcile before either lands, and that is the finding.
2. **A PR that changes a base-anchored artifact's SHAPE goes at a tier boundary**,
   with a regeneration checkpoint immediately after it. Never in the middle of a
   batch.
3. **A PR already conflicting with the base does not enter the order at all.** It
   is rebased first, re-measured, and then placed. Placing it on the strength of
   a plan to fix it is scheduling work that does not exist yet.
4. **Tie-break by FRAGILITY, highest first — not by importance.**

That fourth rule is the one that surprises people, so it carries its reason.
Fragility is *how likely this PR is to stop applying while it waits*, and it is
approximated by breadth of change times distance behind base (predicates 4 and
2). The wide, old PR goes first — not because it matters more, but because its
window is the shortest and every merge ahead of it narrows that window further.
Merging the small clean ones first *feels* like progress and spends the exact
resource the large one is running out of.

Then group into **tiers**: within a tier, no two PRs share a file (predicate 4)
and no latent edge connects them (predicate 5), so a tier merges in any order
and, capacity permitting, concurrently.

## Step 3 — Report shape

Keep it to what was measured.

```
### ref: origin/develop @ 706a6676 | 11 open PRs | 4 idle runners

TIER 1 — merge in any order, no shared files
  #4299  https://github.com/org/repo/pull/4299   docs(observability): the record
         green @ base-12  ·  3 files  ·  no overlap
  #4309  https://github.com/org/repo/pull/4309   feat: gate receipts
         green @ base-0   ·  4 files  ·  no overlap

  ↓ REGENERATE: bun run typecheck:baseline   (tsconfig baseline anchors to
    sourceSha; the squash above orphans it on all remaining PRs)

TIER 2 — sequenced, latent conflicts
  #4242  ...  MUST precede #4120 — clean vs base, conflicts with #4120 on
              .github/workflows/quality-report-allure.yml

NOT IN THE ORDER
  #4054  conflicts with base today. Rebase, re-measure, then place.
  #4124  mergeable: UNKNOWN after two reads — unverifiable, not clean.

CAPACITY  4 idle runners, 6 runs queued. Batch of 2, not 4: each merge
          re-triggers checks on the 9 PRs still open.
```

Every PR row carries its **full URL**. A bare `#4309` is not clickable from a
terminal and not resolvable from a pasted report.

## Degraded modes, stated rather than hidden

- **No `gh` auth** — report distance and collisions from git alone, and say the
  check states are unmeasured. Do not infer green from a clean merge-tree.
- **PR heads not fetchable** (deleted fork, permissions) — that PR is
  `unverifiable`, listed with the reason. It is not "clean".
- **No anchored artifacts found** — say the search ran and found none, with the
  command. Silence reads as "not checked".

## Why the order matters more than it looks

The failure this prevents is quiet. Merging in arrival order does not throw an
error: each merge succeeds, each PR was green when it was measured, and the
breakage surfaces two merges later on a PR whose author changed nothing. The
time is then spent debugging the wrong PR — and the actual cause, a base-anchored
artifact orphaned by a squash three merges back, is the one thing nobody re-reads
because its own PR is already closed and green.
