/**
 * The enforcement-hook configuration observed for a repo, assembled from the
 * Stage 2 LLM observations (see `references/detectors/enforcement-hooks.md`).
 *
 * `ENF` is the **meta-audit that closes the loop**: the other five families
 * (`SCH`, `CDC`, `DDD`, `ARC`, `STR`) *detect* structural drift and *recommend*
 * cures, but detection without enforcement lets the drift return. Per the
 * chimera-os drift thesis 4-cure model, **Cure 4 — PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks**
 * is what makes a structural rule stick: a hook intercepts the offending tool
 * call before (or telemeters after) it lands. `ENF` checks whether those hooks
 * are actually installed.
 *
 * - `repoHooks` — names of the repo-level PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks found in
 *   `.claude/hooks/` (Cure 4a — repo owns its own enforcement).
 * - `toolkitHooksPresent` — whether the toolkit-level enforcement hooks are
 *   inherited (Cure 4b — the shared make-no-mistakes ruleset runs too).
 * - `rulesConfigPresent` — whether a rules config exists (the
 *   `.atomic-design-rules.json` analog) — without it the hooks have nothing to
 *   enforce.
 * - `structuralRules` — the structural rules in force (e.g. the cures the other
 *   five audits recommended); each should be backed by at least one hook whose
 *   name includes the rule substring.
