# post-slack.sh — PostToolUse dispatcher for Slack message tools.
#
# Same dispatcher pattern, but PostToolUse runs AFTER the tool already
# executed — the message has already been sent. We can only emit warnings
# for the next message, never block the one just sent. Therefore we ignore
# any `block` action returned by eval-rule and always exit 0. All stderr
# warnings still surface to the user.
#
# Rules targeting Slack should usually have `action: warn` in rules.yaml.
# A rule with `action: block` here will print its message but won't change
# the outcome — keep that in mind when authoring rules for `applies_to: [Slack]`.
