# Cure 4b cross-cutting hook (legacy-ticket #3): enforce single-version-step
# bumps on any pinned dependency declared in the per-repo config.
#
# Generalized from
# chimera-agent-openclaw-plugin/.claude/hooks/pre-write-openclaw-version-bump-discipline.sh
# (legacy-ticket), which itself wraps scripts/check-openclaw-version-bump.sh
# (PR #220 / legacy-ticket). This 4b version is content-shape-agnostic: per-repo
# config names (a) which files are under discipline, (b) a regex to extract
# the version literal, and (c) a validator script that decides whether the
# step is acceptable.
#
# Surface: `version_bumps` (an array of entries; each entry has its own
#          defer_to_local_hook flag).
# Bypass:  `# hook-bypass: cross-cutting-version-bump`
#
# Old version is extracted from the git HEAD blob of the same path; new
# version from the proposed content. If both extract and differ, the
# named validator script is invoked: `<script> <old> <new> [extra_args...]`.
# Exit 2 from the script → block; exit 0 → pass; any other exit → warn +
# fail-open (defense in depth, never block on validator infrastructure).
#
# Fail-open on missing jq, missing git, malformed input, missing/disabled
# config, missing validator script, or `CLAUDE_DISABLE_PLUGIN_HOOKS=1`.

BLOCKED [${HOOK_NAME}]: version bump rejected by validator.

Attempted file: ${FILE_PATH}
Old version:    ${OLD_VERSION}
New version:    ${NEW_VERSION}
Validator:      ${VALIDATOR_ABS}

The validator script returned exit 2 (block). See its stderr above for
the specific discipline violation and recommended remediation.

Why this hook exists (legacy-ticket / legacy-ticket / legacy-ticket):
  Multi-step version jumps in a single PR hide compatibility breaks
  inside an unreadable diff. The team's largest fix-forward chain
  (PR #218: v2026.4.10 → v2026.5.7, +6 PRs over 8 days,
  ~\$175/day Vertex anomaly) was exactly this failure. The validator
  exists to keep bumps to one step at a time.

Bypass (rare, justify in PR body):
  Add "# hook-bypass: ${BYPASS_MARKER}" to the proposed content.

Defer to local 4a hook:
  Set defer_to_local_hook = true on this entry in
  .claude/config/cross-cutting-hooks.json → version_bumps[].
