# pre-bash-stale-push.sh — Warn when force-pushing a branch that is far behind
# its base (likely to fail CI because the base moved).
#
# Reads the Bash tool's tool_input JSON from stdin (same convention as
# pre-bash.sh), extracts .command, and if it looks like a force push,
# computes how many commits the local HEAD is behind the resolved base
# (origin/HEAD → develop → main → master). If the gap exceeds the threshold,
# emits a multi-line warning to stderr and exits 0.
#
# This hook is WARN-ONLY by design — it never blocks. Force-pushing a stale
# branch is sometimes the correct action (e.g. intentionally diverging fork).
# The hook surfaces the risk; the human decides.
#
# Motivating incident: 2026-05-20 — legacy-ticket atomic migration moved
# src/components/agent/ChatWidget.tsx. PRs #2105, #2107, #1713 in example-platform
# each spent ~10 min diagnosing the same ENOENT failure that a 30-second
# rebase resolved.
